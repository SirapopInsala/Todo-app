This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This app is not yet complete. There are still incomplete parts such as the function to check the priority and the function to check the task when it done. And I don't know how to use Hasura.

***1.0 Update Notes on Dec 13 2023 10.47PM***
-Can check the task when it done and the table is change to green but still have the problem.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
# and run
npm run json-server
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
