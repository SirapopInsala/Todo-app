# Todo-app
This Todo-app used for test
I used the JSON server to implement adding tasks, deleting tasks, and editing tasks. You can run the backend using this "npm run json-server" command in the terminal.

This app does't finishes yet because I don't knows how to create the DoneTask to check the task when it finishes. And I don't knows how to create the function that can prioritize the task.
